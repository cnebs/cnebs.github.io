        <p>
          Hi, there! I'm Charles, a software engineer based in Austin, TX. I've
          been writing code since 2011, and have worked on diverse, distributed
          systems across web, mobile, and bespoke proprietary platforms. I'm
          currently consulting the U.S. Army and helping them to build great
          software practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy taking on unique technical challenges that also offer the
          potential to learn new technologies, and am fortunate to have
          experienced a career filled with these while working alongside very
          bright people.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy traveling, powerlifting, reading, competitive
          gaming, and exporing new technologies.
        </p>
