        <p>
          Hi, there. I'm a developer currently working as a Staff Engineer for IBM Systems Group.
          While I studied Neuroscience in college and initially intended on attending medical school,
          my university experience building a PHP & Drupal e-commerce site for a startup brought me to a fork in the road upon graduation.
          I decided to take a leap of faith to follow my new-found passion by teaching myself
          Node, Typescript, some modern frameworks, and attending Hack Reactor in 2018.
          Just a few months after starting that path, I started my first software job.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy learning new design patterns, contributing to architectural designs, writing user-driven code, and practicing algorithms.
          I have proficiency in the Node and Python ecosystems as well as experience
          building scalable services using both microservices and event-driven architectures.
          I've also designed and produced scalable web-applications for clients;
          if you have application or site build needs, feel free to fill out the contact form below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of the office, I enjoy traveling, hiking, powerlifting, videogames, sci-fi novels,
          and working with bare-metal cloud on my raspberry pis.
        </p>
