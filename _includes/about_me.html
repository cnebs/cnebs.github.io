        <p>
          Hi, there! I'm Charles, a full-stack software engineer based in
          Austin, TX. I'm endlessly curious about all things tech. My specialty
          is the web, and I've spent the last few years working with a range of
          technologies including React, Node, Express, and Python to build
          event-driven microservices. I've been coding since 2011, where I was
          first exposed to an IDE while writing mods for Minecraft servers.
          Since then, I've explored a lot of areas including investment
          automation with Python, e-commerce with Drupal, and even tinkering
          with Raspberry Pis in my own home lab. My passion is in building (and
          at times designing) exceptional, accessible, test-driven, and
          human-centered interfaces that are a pleasure to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Professionally, I've had the opportunity to lead a front-end rewrite
          of a sales gamification platform. I've also had the chance to build
          proof of concepts for enterprise clients, helping them to visualize
          and understand the potential of enterprise technologies. In addition,
          I've co-authored an IBM development course and exam to share knowledge
          and skills with my colleagues. The bulk of my professional experience
          has been spent developing the UI of an enterprise support platform,
          and along the way, I've been fortunate enough to guide and mentor
          interns and junior engineers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, when I'm not learning new tech, I like traveling,
          hiking, powerlifting, reading, and competitive gaming.
        </p>
