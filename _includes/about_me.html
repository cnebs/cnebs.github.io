        <p>
          Hi, there! I'm Charles, a self-taught, full-stack software engineer
          based in Austin, TX. I specialize in web development, and am currently
          working as a consultant for a large DoD client of VMware. I've spent
          the last few years working with a range of web technologies including
          React, Node, Express, GraphQL, Flask, and Spring Boot. I've been
          writing code since 2011, where I was first exposed to an IDE while
          writing mods for Minecraft servers in Java. Since then, I've explored
          trading automation with Python, scaling e-commerce with Drupal, and
          private cloud using Ansible and Kubernetes on Raspberry Pis in my own
          home lab. While I stay up to date with emerging back-end languages and
          technologies, my passion is in building exceptional, accessible,
          test-driven, and human-centered UIs that are a pleasure to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Professionally, I've had the opportunity to lead a front-end rewrite
          of an enterprise sales gamification platform. I've also written proof
          of concepts for clients' cloud deployments, helping them to understand
          the potential of enterprise cloud technologies. In addition, I've
          co-authored an IBM security software development course and exam to
          share knowledge and skills with my colleagues. The bulk of my
          professional experience has been spent developing the an enterprise
          support platform in an Agile team, and along the way, I've been
          fortunate enough to guide and mentor interns and junior engineers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, when I'm not learning new tech, I enjoy traveling,
          powerlifting, reading, and competitive gaming.
        </p>
