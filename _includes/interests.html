			    My personal interests include:
        </p>
			<ul>
			  <li>
         <b>Deep learning</b>. I'm excited for the rapid development in machine learning. I'm studying python and using tensorflow.js in some of my free time.
			  </li>
			  <li>
          <b>Powerlifting</b>. I've been powerlifting for a few years now, and I've built an excel spreadsheet that automates 7 week performance cycles, calculating
          dynamically changing weight values, weekly macronutrient requirements, and works across unit types. Popular in my r/nsuns powerlifting programming community.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>Music</b>. I spend some of my free time learning how to use different music manipulation software, and enjoy all of the live shows available in Austin, TX.
      </li>
