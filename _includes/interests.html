            <b>Cloud, AI, & Health</b>. Coming from a background in neuroscience, I'm excited to watch the gap between
            leading technology and modern health shrink as machine learning improves on the cloud.

            <b>IoT</b>. I've built a private cloud on raspberry pis and automated most of my life; tinkering with
            electronics is a hobby of mine!

            <b>UI & Coffee</b>. Outside of my enterprise security work, I enjoy UI design and React development. This is
            usually fueled by craft coffee.
            I've been working on a React project that aims to improve the workflow of craft coffee makers!

            <b>Food</b>. Texas also happens to offer a diversity of restaurants, and I like to experience as many as I
            can. Sometimes I try to re-create my favorite dishes.
