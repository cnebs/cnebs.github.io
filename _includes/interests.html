            <b>Fitness & Outdoors</b>. I'm currently working on a powerlifting and olympic weightlifting programming platform
            that will be available on all modern devices. You'll be able to design and sell cyclical programs with customizations
            such as per-set formulae for progressive weight calculation and INOL heat mapping, with visualized logging and programmable deloads.
